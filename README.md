# Hello World README

Though I've used Subversion for over 15 years and Mercurial -- another DRCS -- for a couple years, I haven't had any experience with 'git' beyond the DRCS evaluation that yielded the decision to use Mercurial.

The web-based tools are pretty nice, and I'll have to grab the Git Desktop or whatever it's called.  I'm also curious (for my son's sake) whether Eclipse has Git integration for his Minecraft development.  Same question on the Arduino IDE -- I imagine it either has Git integration out of the box or an option to add it.
